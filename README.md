# RetinaFace in PyTorch


## This repository provides a ready to use implementation of Retinaface in Pytorch using Jupyter Notebook.

All code and implementation is taken from [Pytorch Retinaface](https://github.com/biubug6/Pytorch_Retinaface)
I have only gathered and compiled it into a ready to use Jupyter Notebook for education purposes and quick access in Kaggle Competitions.
